                    <p>It has been very hot in Waterloo for the past week, and this week shows very little sign of letting up.
                        I don't have AC in my apartment, so coping with the heat has been a challenge.
                        I've taken to asking Alexa for the temperature multiple times a day, in the hopes that the forecast
                        has changed and I can look forward to cooler weather ahead.
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <p>This past weekend, when I asked Alexa yet again for the temperature that night, I was informed that
                        there would be a low of 16&#8451;, and I got so excited. That might be enough to get my place cool enough
                        at night to last the entire next day! I immediately checked my phone for an hourly forecast, so 
                        I could get an idea of when it would hit that low and how long it would stay there. Imagine my
                        disappointment when the Weather Network showed that it would only hit a low of 18&#8451;, only
                        reach that around 4AM, and then immediately start climbing back to the low 30s.
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <p id="sources">Had Alexa given me false hope? Where does she get her weather data from, anyway?</p>
                    <br>

                </section>
                <section>

                    <h2>
                        Alexa
                    </h2>
                    <br>

                    <p>I decided to ask her. (The following images are screenshots of our conversation taken from the Amazon Alexa app. Our 
                        actual talk was not accompanied by fun pictures.) </p>
                    <img src="images/alexa/turkey.png" alt="What is the source of your weather? - Tigris' source is Turkey" class="center">
                    <br>

                    <p>Okay, maybe I should be more specific:</p>
                    <img src="images/alexa/environment-canada.PNG" alt="Do you get your weather from environment canada? - Sorry, I couldn't find the answer to your question" class="center">
                    <br>

                    <p>Maybe that was too specific.</p>
                    <img src="images/alexa/alexa-information.PNG" alt="Can you tell me where you get your information? - Here's something I found on the web..." class="center">
                    <br>

                    <p>Huh. That raises another question: what are you using to search the Web?</p>
                    <img src="images/alexa/search-engine.PNG" alt="Which search engine do you use to search the web? - Here's something I found on Reference.com..." class="center">
                    <br>

                    <p>Cool, but not an answer to the question I asked. Let's get back to the weather question:</p>
                    <img src="images/alexa/weather-source.PNG" alt="What is the source of your weather data? - Request for comments publication." class="center">
                    <br>

                    <p>What does that even mean? <b>Communication failed.</b></p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Interestingly, the transcripts of our conversation on the Amazon Alexa app <i>did</i> include the source of the information (<a href="https://www.accuweather.com/">AccuWeather.com</a>), along with
                        far more details than are provided in the audio response:
                    </p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/alexa/full-weather.PNG" alt="Alexa app weather forecast, with source" class="center">
                        <figcaption><a href="https://youtu.be/F-X4SLhorvw?t=26">Look at all those</a> numbers!</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <br>

                    <p>So the issue isn't that Alexa doesn't know the source of the information she provides. It's more likely that the developers
                        haven't developed an <i>intent</i> for Alexa to provide the source when asked.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>A few years ago, I developed an Alexa Skill (Alexa skills are to Alexa devices as apps are to smartphones). One of the most
                        challenging parts of that work was defining all of the possible intents. Basically, I had to anticipate the sorts of questions
                        that users would ask and define an intent for each of these question types, to make sure that the skill would recognize and provide what the user wants.
                        If Alexa can't understand my questions about the source of her information, it's probably because the developers
                        did not anticipate that anyone would ask for that, and so didn't define an applicable intent.
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <p>Out of curiousity, I tried asking Siri the same question after asking her for the forecast, and I was pleasantly surprised:</p>
                    <img src="images/alexa/siri.PNG" alt="What's the source of your weather data - I got that from The Weather Channel." class="center">
                    <br>

                    <p>I have no complaints here.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <br>

                    <p>I plugged in my boyfriend's old Google Home to see what it would do. It didn't understand my question, but asked if I wanted to "know
                        where weather com gets it's data?" and when I said yes, it read a blurb from weather.com that described the various ways they gather
                        weather data. Not exactly the answer to my question, but closer to my intention than anything Alexa was able to provide.
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <p>Perhaps I'm being a bit nit-picky. After all, when I ask Alexa about things other than the weather, she almost always
                        begins her response by citing her source. However, it bugs me that Alexa hasn't been set up to engage with questions 
                        about the source of the information she provides. <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/fake-news-misinformation-online-1.5196865">Misinformation and disinformation</a>
                        are huge problems today. Ideally, the everyday technology we use should not contribute to the confusion, but instead should
                        support us as we assess the credibility of the information we consume.
